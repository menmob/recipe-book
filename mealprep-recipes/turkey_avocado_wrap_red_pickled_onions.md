Turkey Avocado Wrap with Pickled Red Onions

Ingredients:
- 1 whole wheat tortilla (8 inch)
- 3 oz deli-sliced turkey breast
- 1/4 medium avocado
- 1/4 cup pickled red onions
- 2 leaves romaine lettuce
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Pickled Red Onions Ingredients:
- 1 medium red onion
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt

Preparation:

Pickled Red Onions:
1. Thinly slice the red onion and place in a heatproof jar or container.
2. In a saucepan, combine the apple cider vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
3. Pour the vinegar mixture over the sliced onions, making sure they're fully submerged.
4. Allow the onions to cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using. They will become more flavorful as they marinate.

Storage Instructions:
1. Keep the pickled red onions in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
2. Wrap the whole wheat tortilla in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it in a cool, dark place.
3. Store the deli-sliced turkey breast in a separate airtight container in the refrigerator.
4. Place the avocado quarter in a small airtight container with the cut surface facing down (to minimize exposure to air), and refrigerate.
5. Rinse the romaine lettuce leaves and pat them dry. Lay the leaves flat between layers of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel, then transfer to a plastic bag and refrigerate.

Assembly:
1. Remove all the ingredients from their respective storage locations.
2. Lay the whole wheat tortilla on a plate to begin.
3. Layer the deli-sliced turkey breast, romaine lettuce leaves, and avocado slices on top of the tortilla.
4. Drain the pickled red onions and add them on top of the avocado. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Roll the tortilla tightly and secure it with a toothpick if necessary to keep it from unrolling.
6. If preferred, heat the wrapped sandwich in a microwave for 30 seconds (or until warmed through) or in a panini press until it's heated and the tortilla is crispy.
