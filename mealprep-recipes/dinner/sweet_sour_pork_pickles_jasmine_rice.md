Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup cubed lean pork shoulder or loin
- 1/2 cup pineapple chunks
- 1/4 cup sliced bell pepper
- 1/4 cup pickled cucumber slices
- 1/2 cup jasmine rice
- 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp brown sugar

Preparation:

1. Cook 1/2 cup of jasmine rice according to package directions. Once cooked, allow it to cool and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar. Set aside.
3. Preheat a large non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add olive oil.
4. Season cubed lean pork with salt and pepper to taste. Add to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides.
5. Remove the browned pork from the skillet and add the sliced bell pepper and pineapple chunks. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly softened.
6. Add the pork back to the skillet along with the sweet and sour sauce. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and the pork is cooked through.
