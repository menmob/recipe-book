Spaghetti Squash and Meatballs with Red Onion Marinara Sauce

Ingredients:
- 1 medium spaghetti squash
- 4 oz lean ground beef or turkey
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- 1 egg
- 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Preparation:

Spaghetti Squash:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Place the halves cut-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until the squash is tender and easily pierced with a fork.
4. Allow the squash to cool, then use a fork to shred the inside into spaghetti-like strands.

Meatballs:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef or turkey, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, and pepper, mixing until well combined.
2. Form the mixture into meatballs (about the size of a golf ball).
3. Bake alongside the spaghetti squash in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through (internal temperature should be 165°F/74°C).

Red Onion Marinara Sauce:
1. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the red onion and garlic, cooking for 3-4 minutes or until the onion is softened.
2. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
3. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flavors are blended.

Storage Instructions:
1. Allow the cooked spaghetti squash, meatballs, and marinara sauce to cool.
2. Store the spaghetti squash strands in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
3. Store the meatballs in a separate airtight container in the refrigerator.
4. Store the red onion marinara sauce in another airtight container in the refrigerator.

Day-of Assembly and Reheating:
1. Remove the spaghetti squash strands, meatballs, and marinara sauce from the refrigerator.
2. Reheat the spaghetti squash strands and meatballs in the microwave for 1-2 minutes, or until heated through. Alternatively, reheat in a preheated 350°F (175°C) oven for 10-15 minutes.
3. Reheat the red onion marinara sauce in a saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until warmed through.
4. To serve, place the spaghetti squash strands on a plate, top with the cooked meatballs, and pour the red onion marinara sauce over the top.
5. Sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
