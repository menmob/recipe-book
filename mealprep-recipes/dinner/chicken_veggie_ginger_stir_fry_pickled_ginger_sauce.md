Chicken and Vegetable Stir-Fry with Pickled Ginger Sauce

Ingredients:
- 8 oz boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup julienned carrots
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup pickled ginger, chopped
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Pickled Ginger Sauce Preparation:
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the chopped pickled ginger, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and cornstarch. Set aside.

Preparation:
1. In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
2. Add the chicken cubes and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant.
4. Add the broccoli, bell pepper, carrots, and red onion to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.
5. Return the chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Stir in the pickled ginger sauce and cook, stirring constantly until the sauce has thickened and evenly coats the chicken and vegetables. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Storage Instructions:
1. Allow the stir-fried chicken and vegetables to cool, then store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
2. Store the pickled ginger sauce in a separate airtight container in the refrigerator.

Day-of Assembly and Reheating:
1. Remove the stir-fried chicken and vegetables and the pickled ginger sauce from the refrigerator.
2. Reheat the stir-fried chicken and vegetables in a skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until heated through.
3. If the pickled ginger sauce has thickened too much during storage, stir in 1-2 tablespoons of water to achieve the desired consistency. Heat the sauce in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed.
4. Pour the warmed pickled ginger sauce over the heated stir-fried chicken and vegetables, stirring to coat evenly.
5. Serve the chicken and vegetable stir-fry over rice or noodles, if desired.
