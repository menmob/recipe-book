- 1 whole-wheat hamburger bun
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 slice provolone cheese
- 1/4 cup mixed greens
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Preparation:
1. Preheat grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
2. Brush both sides of the portobello mushroom and red onion slices with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Grill the mushroom for 4-5 minutes per side or until tender. Grill the red onion slices for 2-3 minutes per side or until softened and slightly charred.
4. Just before the mushroom is finishing on the grill, add the provolone cheese on top, allowing it to melt slightly.

2. Store the mixed greens in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.

Day-of Assembly and Reheating:
1. Remove the mushroom, red onion slices, and mixed greens from the refrigerator.

3. Toast the hamburger bun in a toaster or under a broiler until golden and crispy.
4. Assemble the sandwich with the mixed greens on the bottom bun, followed by the grilled mushroom with melted cheese, and then the red onion slices.
