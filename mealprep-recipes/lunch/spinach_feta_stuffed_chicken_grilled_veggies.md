Spinach and Feta Stuffed Chicken with Grilled Vegetables

Ingredients:
- 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 6 oz)
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
- 1 small zucchini, sliced
- 1 small red bell pepper, sliced
- 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Preparation:
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Slice the chicken breast horizontally, creating a pocket, being careful not to cut all the way through.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the crumbled feta cheese and chopped spinach.
4. Stuff the chicken breast with the spinach and feta mixture, using toothpicks to secure the chicken if necessary.
5. Place the stuffed chicken breast in a baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches 165°F/75°C).
6. After the chicken finishes, preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Lightly coat the zucchini and red bell pepper slices with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Grill the zucchini and red bell pepper slices for 3-4 minutes per side, or until they're tender and have grill marks.

Storage Instructions:
1. Once the stuffed chicken has cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
2. Store the grilled zucchini and red bell pepper in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Day-of Assembly (and possible reheating):
